# Gamemind-Langgraph-Recommender
# 🎮 GameMind — Intelligent Game Recommendation Agent

GameMind is a **production-style AI recommendation system** built using **LangGraph**, **LLMs**, and **embedding-based semantic search**.

It demonstrates how to design **reliable, explainable, and deterministic AI agents** by combining:
- LLMs for planning and explanation
- Embeddings for similarity search
- Rule-based ranking for control and interpretability
- LangGraph for orchestration and control flow

This project is intentionally designed **without training deep learning models**, focusing instead on **system architecture and correctness**.
